An API and Front-end that allows a user to record distant memories, and more recent throughts and brainstorming notes.

It's meant to be as easy as possible to record notes, and easy to browse casually in future. The front-end will have a "whispy" theme; it's not meant to be serious or formal at all.

The goal is to have an easy space for a person to record things, so that the person can browse the notes later on to remember where they come from, or to noticehow things have actually changed (or stayed the same).
